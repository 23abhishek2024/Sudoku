## 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Used 📊

This project isn’t just about frontend — it implements classic **DSA concepts** behind the scenes for efficient gameplay and puzzle-solving.

- 📑 **2D Matrix Operations** — The Sudoku board is managed as a 9×9 matrix.
- 📏 **Constraint Validation** — Each move is validated against Sudoku rules for rows, columns, and subgrids.
- 🔄 **Recursive Backtracking (DFS)** — The solver uses Depth-First Search and backtracking to fill the Sudoku board.
- 📝 **Input Validation & Traversal** — Iterates through 2D arrays (matrices) for checking empty cells and conflicts.
- ⚡ **Matrix Traversal Algorithms** — Row-wise, column-wise, and 3×3 subgrid checks implemented efficiently.
- 🧩 **Sudoku Constraint Checking Algorithm** — Validates each input number against all Sudoku constraints before placing it.
